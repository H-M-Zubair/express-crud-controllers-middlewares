1.  # Project Title 
    Express.js CRUD API with Middlewares and Controllers

2.  # Project Description
    This project is an Express.js application that demonstrates the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for APIs, along with middlewares, error handling, and the use of controllers to structure the codebase. The application is designed to be a learning resource for understanding how to build and organize a RESTful API using Express.js.

- **CRUD Operations:** Implemented all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for resources.
- **Controllers:** Separated business logic into controllers to keep the routes clean and maintainable.
- **Middlewares:** Utilized Express.js middlewares for logging, validation, and error handling.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented centralized error handling for improved application stability and debugging.
- **Modular Structure:** Adopted a modular code structure for scalability and maintainability.

4.  # Technologies Used
    ## Technologies Used
- **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Used modern JavaScript syntax and features.
- **Nodemon:** Tool for automatically restarting the server during development.
